Stream 51: Group 1: Bus Tracking App

Welcome to our SDP git repository.

<h3>Project Pitches</h3>

Bus Tracking Application
Owners:  James Joung, Tae Hyun Kim
 
Built in Android Application
Feature:
User can select bus timetable by location area
User can select bus timetable by bus stop number
User can select bus timetable by bus number
User receive live time gps info of the bus’ location
User is alerted before the bus arrives.
User is alerted when to get off the bus
 
Novelty:
Current AT bus app’s first look of the design is not an eye catching, our app will provide user friendly design that is light but easily noticed. UI design analysis.
Current AT bus app does not provide notification for those riding bus to a destination for the first time does not know where to get off or frequent rider may miss drop off stop. Ou
r app will let the user know when to get off by notification and live bus movement design.
 
Notes:
We are team of two strong developers seeking designer for gui, and product developer.


Thank You,
